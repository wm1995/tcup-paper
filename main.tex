(Each point is ~1 paragraph.)

Regression generally important in astronomy (e.g., M-$\sigma$)

Astronomy data well characterised errors, but with some outliers

Previously sigma-clipping or outlier removal; better to model the full measurement process

Review of previous methods (e.g., Kelly)

Characterise as an example of robust inference (i.e., don't need to know the actual generating distribution); mention some existing uses of this (e.g., Feeney, Park)

Then say presenting practical methodology and implementation here.
}

There are multiple approaches to the problem of linear regression in astronomy
where all variables are measured with error.  \citet{Kelly:2007} illustrates
that ad-hoc estimators such as \textsc{fitexy} \citep{Press:1992, Tremaine:2002}
and \textsc{bces} \citep{Akritas:1996} suffer from biases and can underestimate
intrinsic scatter. As an alternative, Kelly presents a Bayesian hierarchical
model for linear regression with measurement errors as an alternative. However,
the model is designed to be sampled using Gibbs sampling, which limits the
choice of distributions for variables within the model and the number of
parameters that can be fit simultaneously. As a result of the former, the model
assumes random variables are normally distributed throughout; however, inference
that relies on normal distributions can be unduly affected by outliers (see
\citet{Berger:1994} for a review of robust Bayesian inference).  One possible
alternative is to use Student's $t$-distributions, which have heavier tails and
are, therefore, less affected by the presence of outliers \citep{Berger:1994};
Student's $t$-distributions have seen use in astronomical
\citep[][e.g.]{Park:2017} and cosmological \citep[][e.g.]{Feeney:2018}
inference.

Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs) are a natural way to deal with datasets with
measurement errors, selection effects, interlinked parameters, censored data,
and many other effects common to astronomical problems. BHMs have seen
increasing use in astrophysics over the past 30 years, from the
distance-redshift relation in cosmology \citep[e.g.][]{Feeney:2018,
Avelino:2019} and photometric redshift estimation \citep[e.g.][]{Leistedt:2016}
to exoplanet characterisation \citep[e.g.][]{Sestovic:2018} and population-level
inference \citep[e.g.][]{Kelly:2009} --- see \citet{Feigelson:2021} for a recent
review of statistical methods in astrophysics, including further examples of
BHMs.

\citet{Kelly:2007} formulated a Bayesian linear regression model under the
assumption of Gaussianity and compared it with other common regression methods
in astronomy, including ordinary least squares, \textsc{bces}
\citep{Akritas:1996}, and \textsc{fitexy} \citep{Press:1992, Tremaine:2002}.
\citeauthor{Kelly:2007} found that the Bayesian approach had several advantages
over the other methods considered: no bootstrapping was required to obtain
uncertainties on parameters; the Bayesian approach was easily extensible to
truncated or censored data; and other methods would sometimes severely
underestimate intrinsic scatter in the data. This formulation of Bayesian
regression, sometimes known as \textsc{linmix\_err}, is now commonly used in
astronomy \citep[e.g.][]{McConnell:2013, Bentz:2013, Andrews:2013}.

When we have a dataset that has a large number of outliers, our inference of
certain parameters can be drawn off by the presence of those outliers. Robust
inference refers to a body of techniques to fit in an outlier-resistant way so
that we can recover the parameters of interest while not being unduly affected
by the outliers.  For example, ordinary least squares regression is based on the
assumption that datapoints are normally distributed about a true regression
line; however, normal distributions have exponential tails, which means that
this approach is often heavily affected by the presence of outliers (see Section
\ref{sec:results} for an exploration of this effect). An alternative approach is
to use heavier-tailed distributions.  Examples of this include least absolute
deviation regression, where the data is assumed to be Laplace-distributed about
the regression line.  Another distribution that can be used is Student's
$t$-distribution \citep[e.g.][]{Berger:1994, Gelman:2013}, which also has
heavier tails than a normal distribution --- see Section \ref{sec:results} for a
comparison of regression using normal distributions and $t$-distributions.

There are several approaches to robust inference in a Bayesian context
--- see \citet{Berger:1994} for a review. Examples of applications of robust
inference in astronomy include \citet{Park:2017, Feeney:2018}.

From the review of previous methods, we can identify properties that we would
like to see in our regression model:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A Bayesian hierarchical model -- we favour a hierarchical approach
	because it naturally encodes the hierarchical structure of astronomical
	regression problems (i.e.\ objects are drawn from a high-level population;
	the objects intrinsically obey some relationship; the objects are measured
	with error and only the measured values are known). We favour a Bayesian
	approach because it gives posterior distributions encoding our degree of
	belief of the values of parameters, quantifying our uncertainty in their
	values.

	\item A robust model -- we desire a model that is robust to both outliers
	(i.e.\ data points that, whether intrinsically or by virtue of measurement
	errors, do not lie on our regression relation) and model misspecification
	(i.e.\ where the underlying distribution of data does not match up with the
	distribution assumed for modelling).

	\item A general method -- we seek a model that does not require case-by-case
	optimisation for application to different regression problems (e.g.\ no
	manual outlier identification and removal, no need to rescale prior
	distributions for different problems, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Formalism}
\label{sec:formalism}

Let us observe $N$ objects, each with $\{\hat{x}_i, \hat{y}_i,
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i\}$, representing the independent variable, the dependent
variable, and the covariance matrix of the observed quantities.  We can further
assume that each observation represents a true-but-unobserved latent object
$\{x_i, y_i\}$, with these quantities related by
\begin{eqnarray}
    y_i &=& \alpha x_i + \beta + \epsilon_i \\
    \epsilon_i &\sim& \mathcal{P} \left( \sigma_{\text{int}} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
for regression parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left\{\alpha, \beta,
\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}\right\}$ and some probability distribution $P\left(
\hat{\mathbf{x}}, \hat{\mathbf{y}} \mid \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \Sigma \right)$
linking the latent values with the observed values.

\subsection{Regression model}
\label{sec:formalism.model}

Similarly to \citet{Kelly:2007}, we define a Bayesian hierarchical model to
reflect the nature of the regression problem. Firstly, we assume that the
dependent variable $\{\depvar\}$ and the independent variables $\{\indepvars\}$
have a linear relationship with some underlying scatter $\intscttr$ -- i.e.

\begin{equation}
\depvar \sim \studentt{\covariate \indepvars + \intercept}{\intscttr}.
\end{equation}

We use a Student's $t$-distribution here not because we believe that the data
intrinsically follows this distribution, but because the resulting model is more
robust to outliers at the object level -- such as if a galaxy were to be an
outlier from a particular relation as a result of a recent merger.

The quantities $\{\depvar\}$ and $\{\indepvars\}$ are, however, rarely known
exactly; instead, we measure the observables $\{\obsdep\}$ and $\{\obsindep\}$
with covariance $\{\obserr\}$ in the most general case. This measurement is
modelled as

\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \obsdep \\ \obsindep
    \end{pmatrix}
    \sim
    \studentt{
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \depvar \\ \indepvars
        \end{pmatrix}
    }{
        \obserr
    }.
\end{equation}

Once again, we use a Student's $t$-distribution because the resulting model is
more robust to outliers -- in this case, the object itself is not an outlier
from a relation, but the observed quantities are outliers as a result of their
measurement.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{graphics/dag.pdf}
    \caption{A directed acyclic graph representing the $t$-cup model.}
    \label{fig:formalism.dag}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sampling distribution}
\label{sec:formalism.sampling}

Student's $t$-distributions are encountered when estimating the mean of a normal
distribution with unknown variance from a limited number of samples. The number
of samples is a parameter of the distribution: for $n$ samples, the
corresponding Student's $t$-distribution will have $\nu \equiv n - 1$
``degrees-of-freedom''. This value of $\nu$ parameterises how heavy-tailed the
distribution is. While the interpretation of $\nu$ as ``degrees-of-freedom''
only makes sense for $\nu \in \mathbb Z^+$, the distribution is normalisable for
any positive, real $\nu$; for this reason, we shall refer to $\nu$ as the shape
parameter. Constructing a statistical model that treats this shape parameter as
a free parameter to be fitted allows the model to adapt to outliers in the data,
reverting to the result of a model that uses normal distributions in the absence
of outliers \citep{Feeney:2018}. In this context, $\nu$ is considered a
nuisance parameter: its exact value is unimportant, and its inclusion in the
model is solely to ensure that inference is robust to outliers.

The Student's $t$-distribution has probability density function
\begin{equation}
    \studentt{\mu}{\sigma}
        =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \nu} \sigma}
    \frac{
        \Gamma \left(\frac{\nu + 1}2\right)
    }{
        \Gamma \left(\frac{\nu}2\right)
    }
    \left(
        1 + \frac{1}{\nu} \frac{\left(x - \mu\right)^2}{\sigma^2}
    \right)^{
        -\frac{\nu + 1}{2}
    }.
\end{equation}
Plots of a range of $\nu$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:model.t}; note that $\nu
= 1$ gives a Cauchy distribution, and $\nu \rightarrow \infty$ tends to a normal
distribution. The distribution has mean
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}(x)
        =
    \begin{cases}
        \mu & \nu > 1, \\
        \textrm{undefined} & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and variance
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Var}(x)
        =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{\nu}{\nu - 2} \sigma^2 & \phantom{2 \leq} \nu > 2, \\
        \infty & 2 \leq \nu > 1, \\
        \textrm{undefined} & \textrm{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Priors on $t$-distribution parameters}
\label{sec:formalism.sampling.prior}

It can be informative to reparameterise the shape parameter $\nu$ in a few
different ways. Following \citet{Feeney:2018}, we can define the peak height
ratio $t$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
    t(\nu) &=& \frac{
        \studentt{x = \mu; \mu}{\sigma}
    }{
        \mathcal N \left(x = \mu; \mu, \sigma \right)
    } \\
    &=& \sqrt{\frac{2}{\nu}} \;
    \frac{
        \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)
    }{
        \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)
    }.
\end{eqnarray}
As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:model.peak_height}, the behaviour of $t(\nu)$
is highly non-linear, reflecting that, for $\nu \gtrsim 10$, the Student's
$t$-distribution rapidly approaches a normal distribution.

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics{scripts/peak-height.pdf}
%     \caption{A plot of peak height ratio $t$ with varying shape parameter $\nu$}
%     \label{fig:model.peak_height}
% \end{figure}

As we are using the flexibility of Student's $t$-distributions to adapt to
datasets with outliers, it can also be useful to consider the outlier fraction
$\omega$. If we define outliers as any points lying more than $3\sigma$ from the
mean $\mu$, the outlier fraction is
\begin{eqnarray}
    \omega(\nu)
    &=& P\left(
        \left|x - \mu \right| > 3 \sigma \;
        \middle| \;
        x \sim \studentt{\mu}{\sigma}
    \right) \\
    &=& 2 F_\nu \left(\mu - 3 \sigma \right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_\nu(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function for Student's
$t$-distribution with shape parameter $\nu$. Figure \ref{fig:model.outlier_frac}
shows the relationship between outlier fraction $\omega$ and shape parameter
$\nu$, with $\omega \rightarrow 2.70 \times 10^{-3} $ in the limit of a normal
distribution --- i.e., as $\nu \rightarrow \infty$. We would, therefore, expect
that approximately 1 in 370 datapoints would be outliers for data that follows a
normal distribution\footnotemark; for Cauchy-distributed data (i.e. $\nu = 1$),
we would expect every fifth datapoint to be an outlier.

\footnotetext{As of the time of writing, we know of $\sim$300 $z > 6$ quasars
\citep{Bosman:2020}; under the assumption of normality, we would expect no
outliers in this dataset.}

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics{scripts/outlier-frac.pdf}
%     \caption{Outlier fraction $\omega$ as a function of $\nu$ - for large $\nu$,
%     $\omega$ tends to the Gaussian limit value of $\omega \rightarrow 2.70
%     \times 10^{-3}$}
%     \label{fig:model.outlier_frac}
% \end{figure}

Using Student's $t$-distributions for robust Bayesian inference means that we
have to specify a prior on the shape parameter $\nu$. One approach is to adopt a
fixed value of $\nu$, which is equivalent to setting a Dirac delta function
prior: a common choice is $\nu = 4$ \citep[e.g.][]{Berger:1994, Gelman:2013}.
Another approach is to adopt a more flexible approach by allowing $\nu$ to vary
\citep[e.g.][]{Juarez:2010, Park:2017, Feeney:2018}.

In \citet{Feeney:2018}, it is argued that, for common choices of prior, too
much prior density is placed on large values of $\nu$; to rectify this, they
propose a uniform prior on peak height $t \sim U\left(0, 1\right)$. As this
prior has no closed form derivative (a requirement for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo),
they approximate this with the prior
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal P\left(\nu\right) \propto
    \frac{
        \Theta(\nu)
    }{
        \left(
            \left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^{1 / (2 a)}
            + \left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^{2 / a}
        \right)^a
    }
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(\nu)$ is the Heaviside step function, and $\nu_0$ and $a$ are
constants with values $\sim 0.55$ and $\sim 1.2$ respectively.  One feature of
this prior is that it has significant density for $0 < \nu < 1$; in extreme
cases, this can correspond to outliers that are more than 100 orders of
magnitude larger than $\sigma$. In theory, these unphysical regions of parameter
space ought to be excluded during the process of inference. However, the use of
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in such cases can lead to divergences in the
sampling process or inefficient sampling as the sampler struggles with regions
of high curvature --- see Section \ref{sec:model.model.reparam} for greater
detail.

Another possible prior is on outlier fraction $\omega$. It could be argued that
the term outlier loses its meaning when the majority of a dataset is composed of
so-called ``outliers''; therefore, a natural choice of prior might be a uniform
distribution ranging from the normally-distributed outlier fraction of
$\sim$0.00270 to this ``maximum'' outlier fraction of 0.5, corresponding to $\nu
\sim 0.302$. This still leads to large outliers (some of 8 orders of magnitude
for 100 draws from the distribution), which are unphysical and continue to
present difficulties when sampling with HMC.

To limit the number of unphysical outliers, we can instead limit the prior to
consider only distributions that are less heavy-tailed than the Cauchy
distribution --- i.e. all those with $\nu > 1$. This prior can be set on either
peak height $t$ or outlier fraction $\omega$.

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics{scripts/scaled-peak-height.pdf}
%     \caption{Rescaled peak height $\tilde{t}$ as a function of $\nu$; also
%     illustrated is the approximation given in Equation \ref{eqn:model.t_approx}.
%     }
%     \label{fig:model.t_approx}
% \end{figure}

After considering a range of priors, we have adopted a prior which is
approximately uniform on peak height between Cauchy and normal distributions.
We achieve this by rescaling peak height $t$ to $\tilde{t}$, such that
$\tilde{t} = 0$ corresponds to a Cauchy distribution, and $\tilde{t} = 1$
corresponds to a normal distribution. We adopt a uniform prior $\tilde{t} \sim
U\left(0, 1\right)$, and then approximate the function
\begin{equation}
    \nu\left(\tilde{t}\right)
        \approx
    \sec \left(\frac{\pi}{2} \sqrt{\tilde{t}} \right);
    \label{eqn:model.t_approx}
\end{equation}
this approximation (illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:model.t_approx}) is accurate
to within 3\% and provides an analytic derivative for HMC.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:formalism.implementation}

The chosen statistical model is implemented in Stan \citep{Stan}, which is used
to draw samples via a HMC No U-Turn Sampler. The implementation is packaged as
$t$-cup, available as a Python package\footnotemark.

For the purposes of comparison, we have also implemented a model that mirrors
the above structure, but uses normal distributions at each stage --- this model
is referred to as $n$-cup.

\section{Results on simulated datasets}
\label{sec:results}

In the previous section, we proposed a general-purpose, robust statistical model
for linear regression; in this section, we investigate the performance of the
model on a series of simulated datasets with known parameters. Code that
reproduces the datasets in this section is available online\footnotemark.

\subsection{Normally-distributed data}

Simulate data-sets with different numbers of outliers (just normally distributed
with no outliers; normally distributed with a chosen fraction of manual
outliers; t distributed with a chosen shape parameter; drawn from some other
heavy-tailed distribution such as a normal mixture or exponential/Laplace;
asymmetric, such a log-normal).  Basic presentation of results will be similar
for each case: showing the simulated data with posterior draws of fitted
lines/curves (as in your presentation plots) and corner plots

\section{Demonstration on real-world data}
\label{sec:real-world}

A simple demonstration on real data (Park is a possibility; another is an
M-sigma analysis; possibly the data from the Kelly paper).  Suggest trying this
on the paper used by Kelly as can directly compare.

Previous work that has employed the $t$-distributions has used different
priors for the shape parameter $\nu$, which controls how heavy-tailed the
distribution is. Previous priors suggested include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item priors of the form $\nu \sim {\rm Inv-}\Gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ for some
          $\left\{\alpha, \beta\right\}$ -- e.g.
          \citet{Juarez:2010} uses $\left\{\alpha = 2, \beta = 10\right\}$;
          \citet{Ding:2014} uses $\left\{\alpha = 1, \beta = 10\right\}$
    \item A uniform prior in $\frac1\nu \sim U(0, 1)$ \citep{Gelman:2013}
    \item A uniform prior in distribution peak height relative to a normal
    distribution, such that
    \begin{equation}
        \sqrt{\frac2\nu}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} \sim U(0, 1).
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
These priors are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:priors.pdf}.

A uniform proper prior in $\frac1\nu$ gives a hard cutoff in $\nu$, which
renders regions of parameter space inaccessible (in the case of the
\citet{Gelman:2013} prior, $\nu = 1$ is the cutoff, which corresponds to a
Cauchy distribution.) On the other hand, the prior used in \citet{Feeney:2018}
has disproportionate prior density at low values of $\nu$, which corresponds to
models with outliers several orders of magnitude larger than the predicted
effect size.

It can also be instructive to calculate the ``outlier fraction'' for different
values of $\nu$. We define the outlier fraction $\omega$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \omega(\nu) &=& \mathcal P\left(|x - \mu| > 3 \sigma \mid x \sim t_\nu (\mu, \sigma^2) \right) \\
    &=& I\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu + 3^2};\frac\nu2, \frac12\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $I(x; \alpha, \beta)$ is the regularised beta function. For a normal
distribution, we expect about 0.27\% of points to be outliers greater than
3~$\sigma$ from the mean --- i.e. $\lim_{\nu \rightarrow \infty}\omega(\nu)
\approx 0.0027$; for a Cauchy distribution, $\omega(\nu = 1) \approx 0.20$.

The cumulative distribution functions for the priors in terms of outlier
fraction are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:priors.outlier_frac}.

In this work, we use the prior
\begin{equation}
    \nu \sim {\rm Inv-}\Gamma(3, 10),
\end{equation}
where ${\rm Inv-}\Gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ is an inverse gamma distribution with
{\color{red} shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\beta$}.

This prior was chosen for two reasons:
