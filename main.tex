% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
A Bayesian hierarchical model for robust linear regression in the presence of measurement error is described.
The performance of the model is assessed on both simulated and real datasets.
The code is made available for others to use.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

(Each point is ~1 paragraph.)

Regression generally important in astronomy (e.g., M-$\sigma$)

Astronomy data well characterised errors, but with some outliers

Previously sigma-clipping or outlier removal; better to model the full measurement process

Review of previous methods (e.g., Kelly)

Characterise as an example of robust inference (i.e., donâ€™t need to know the actual generating distribution); mention some existing uses of this (e.g., Feeney, Park)

Then say presenting practical methodology and implementation here.

\section{Formalism}
\label{sec:formalism}

\subsection{Regression model}
\label{sec:formalism.model}

\subsection{Sampling distribution}
\label{sec:formalism.sampling}

\subsubsection{Priors on $t$-distribution parameters}
\label{sec:formalism.sampling.prior}

\subsection{Asymptotic normality}
\label{sec:formalism.asymptotic}

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:formalism.implementation}

% Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
% It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

% \subsection{Maths}
% \label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

% Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
% or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
% as a numbered equation:

% \begin{equation}
%     x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
% 	\label{eq:quadratic}
% \end{equation}

% Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

% \subsection{Figures and tables}

% Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
% worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

% Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
% e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

\section{Results on simulated datasets}

Simulate data-sets with different numbers of outliers (just normally distributed with no outliers; normally distributed with a chosen fraction of manual outliers; t distributed with a chosen shape parameter; drawn from some other heavy-tailed distribution such as a normal mixture or exponential/Laplace; asymmetric, such a log-normal).  Basic presentation of results will be similar for each case: showing the simulated data with posterior draws of fitted lines/curves (as in your presentation plots) and corner plots

\section{Demonstration on real-world data}

A simple demonstration on real data (Park is a possibility; another is an M-sigma analysis; possibly the data from the Kelly paper).  Suggest trying this on the paper used by Kelly as can directly compare.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    Column width is \the\columnwidth.
    Text width is \the\textwidth.
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

	\label{tab:example_table}

\end{table}


\section{Conclusions}

Summarise the take-home point that the method is a form of robust inference; works on all sorts of outliers; then lead on to use in Paper 2 on the mass ladder.

colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.

\section*{Data Availability}

 
The inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in MNRAS. Data Availability Statements provide a standardised format for readers to understand the availability of data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement may refer to original data generated in the course of the study or to third-party data analysed in the article. The statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required accession numbers for the relevant databases or DOIs.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{example} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
