  abstract = {Cox’s theorem provides a theoretical basis for using probability theory as a general logic of plausible inference. The theorem states that any system for plausible reasoning that satisfies certain qualitative requirements intended to ensure consistency with classical deductive logic and correspondence with commonsense reasoning is isomorphic to probability theory. However, the requirements used to obtain this result have been the subject of much debate. We review Cox’s theorem, discussing its requirements, the intuition and reasoning behind these, and the most important objections, and finish with an abbreviated proof of the theorem.}

We suppose that each of the observations in an experiment in an experiment may come from either a ‘good’ run or a ‘bad’ run. By specifying the models corresponding to good and bad runs and the prior probabilities of which runs being bad, we then employ standard Bayesian inference procedures to derive the appropriate analysis. In particular, we consider the linear model and assume that a good observation is normally distributed about its mean with variance σ2, and a bad one is normal with the same mean but a larger variance k2σ2.
